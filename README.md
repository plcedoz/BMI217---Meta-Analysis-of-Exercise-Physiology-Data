# BMI217---Meta-Analysis-of-Exercise-Physiology-Data
Exercise has been associated with good health and muscle activity. Regular exercising is highly correlated towards improvement of health and treatment of diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Hence, it is important that we understand the underlying mechanisms behind exercise at the molecular level. Gene expression changes associated with exercise training are critical aspects that are involved in these health benefits. With this goal in mind, the primary aim of our project is to identify genes associated with exercise performance. We intend to analyse these genes and find associations between them with cardiac disease phenotypes with potential diagnostic implications. We aim to use a set of intervention studies and compare pre and post transcriptomic profiles across all genes differentially expressed pre and post exercise. We plan to compare these gene expression profiles to the ELITE database containing variants of interest and identify genes that are implicated in extreme cases: cardiac patients and athletes. This will provide us with a list of gene candidates with a range of response profiles. We then intend to identify biomarkers for these genes that have diagnostic applications.
